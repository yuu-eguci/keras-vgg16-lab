keras-vgg16-lab
===

⚗️ The repository for experiment of Keras, Vgg16 and Fine tuning. The purposes are to practice Fine tuning with "17 flowers" with my own hands and to get to be able to explain Keras, Vgg16 and Fine tuning with my own mouse.

## Installation

I don't know why but Keras and Tensorflow occur pipenv "Locking failed!" error.  
So I gave up pipenv to create corrent Pipfile.lock.

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv run pip install -r requirements.txt
```
